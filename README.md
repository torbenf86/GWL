Train

Scikit is used to train a SVM model. The labels are the 29 european weather patterns of Hess and Brezowsky Grosswetterlagen. The labels are taken from the German Meteorological Service (DWD), which provide a daily overview for the weather patterns over the past years: https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/grosswetterlage/grosswetterlage.html

The sea-level pressure and the geopotential at 500 hpa were selected as features. These variables are taken from the NCEP reanalysis at each node between 40째W / 40째E and 20째N / 70째N, which can be found at https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.pressure.html. All variables are flattened to feature vector. 10 % of the data is used as test data.
